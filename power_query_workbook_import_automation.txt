// M Code used to automatically import the correct file into Power Query based on the file path. Note: file path naming convention needs to be consistent.

//Steps In Excel Workbook

//1. Open Power Query Create and create a Blank Query
//2. Enter the below code in the blank query and rename it fParam

let Parameter=(TableName as text,RowNumber as number) =>
let
     Source = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name=TableName]}[Content],
     value = Source{RowNumber-1}[Path]
in
     value
in Parameter

//3. Create table in excel on "Folder Path" tab with the file path. Name the table "tableConfig" and name the column with the file path "Path"
//4. Use this M code in your query

let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents(fParam("tableConfig",1)), null, true),
   //add transformation steps as needed
in
   Source

//5. Use excel's CONCAT() function so that the file path updates based on a cell input (e.g. current date)

//6. Refresh Query
